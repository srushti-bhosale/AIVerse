# AIVerse: Leveraging GAI capabilities in a web application for multimedia generation

●	Platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini primarily focus on conversation, although they may    offer code-related functionalities, they do not provide art generation facilities.
●	Also, platforms like OpenArt and Dall E provide only image generation but not chat,music generation,video generation,code generation etc
●	Similarly, there are other platforms which lack one feature of the other for generation. The below table illustrates the same-
●	The aim of our web application is to provide all generation features i.e. conversation, image generation,music generation, video generation and code generation on a single platform.

Implementation-
1.	To get started, user has to click “Start Generating for Free” / “Get Started”
2.	For Authentication, a user can either log in via his/her Google Account or sign up via his/her email id and password.
3.	Users will now be redirected to the Dashboard where they can see and use all the generation features i.e. conversation , image editing, audio generation, video generation and code generation.
4.	For conversation, the users can provide a text prompt and the application will generate a text solution for it or provide an image and text prompt to receive a text solution.
5.	For image editing, the users can repaint the background of their images by providing the text prompt and input image. They can also deblur their images by providing the blurred input image.  These generated images can also be downloaded.
6.	For audio generation, the users can provide a text prompt and sample music file link. The web application will make changes in the music file according to the text prompt.
 They can also enhance the quality of their audio clips by providing the input audio. 
7.	For video generation, the users can add captions to their videos by providing the input video. They can also generate the transcript of their videos and then make cuts to the video by editing its transcript. 
8.	For code generation , the user has to provide a text prompt and the web application will generate the required code snippet.
9.	In the settings tab, the user can check whether he/she is on the free plan and upgrade to pro if necessary. 
10.	Users can keep a track of the free tier by checking the bottom left corner and also upgrade to pro from there. After 10 generations, users will have to upgrade to pro to continue using the web application.
11.	By clicking on upgrade , the user will be redirected to a checkout page where he/she will have to enter card  and billing details.
12. If the user has any queries, he/she can chat with the customer support chatbot which is available in the web application.
